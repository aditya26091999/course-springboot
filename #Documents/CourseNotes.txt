Create a simple maven project using IntelliJ Idea
Create the remote repository on Github
Open the local project in IDE's terminal to configure local git repository
Perform "git init"
Perform "git remote add origin <URL of the github project>"
On GitHub, go to settings/developer settings/personal access tokens to generate a token
This token will act as password for authorizing remote push requests
Perform "git pull origin master" to fetch README.md files created on GitHub remote repo
Perform "git checkout -b <new-branch-name>" this creates a local branch
Configure the project to be a Spring Project by adding maven dependency to the POM.xml file
"""
    <dependencies>

        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
            <version>5.3.14</version>
        </dependency>

    </dependencies>
"""
Refresh the maven project, so that all the spring dependencies are downloaded from remote to local project
Add a .gitignore file to exclude folder target that contains Java build artifacts.
